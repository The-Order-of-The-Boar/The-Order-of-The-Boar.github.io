Hello to all Boars in the Empire,


Today i'm going to talk about the musical version of **The Fall Of Gil-Galad** from Clamavi de Profundis, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPFwrmgLvQ).

The original version is an poem written by J. R. R. Tolkien to the universe of The Lord of The Rings. It has 3 stanzas with 4 verses each and talks about Gil-Galad, an legendary king of the elves from a distant age.


First, let's take a look at the lyrics:
    
    1  Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
    2  Of him the harpers sadly sing:
    3  the last whose realm was fair and free
    4  between the Mountains and the Sea.

    5  His sword was long, his lance was keen,
    6  his shining helm afar was seen;
    7  the countless stars of heaven's field
    8  were mirrored in his silver shield.

    9  But long ago he rode away,
    10 and where he dwelleth none can say;
    11 for into darkness fell his star
    12 in Mordor where the shadows are.

In the first stanzas, we have the introduction of who was Gil-Galad, and becomes clear that he was loved by the people. Also in the third verse "the last whose realm was fair and free", we can assume that the new kings don't have a big appeal from the people, and can't be compared with the greatness of Gil-Galad. 

In the second one, we have an more detailed description of him: the fifth verse says how he was a great warrior; the sixth how he was an moralizing figure in the battlefield.

In the last one, we have turning point, now Gil-Galad is not more portrayed with glory, because now he's dead.The first verse of this stanza tells us about this death, and the last three are very sad, because the hero is death like a indigent, with his body in the middle of the darkness.

Now let's move to the musical version from Clamavi De Profundis.The first stanza is sung with a melancholy voice, giving us the sentiment that the elven king that is being introduced is really missed in the hearts of the people.

The second changes the voice a little bit, now it's very excited remembering the glory of the past times.

As in the poem, there's a great change in the third stanza. It's like the narrator falls deep in the sadness, when he says that Gil-Galad is death. The voice and music keep up with this, becoming sadder.
