            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello to all Boars in the Empire,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today i&#x27;m going to talk about the musical version of &lt;strong&gt;The Fall Of Gil-Galad&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; from Clamavi de Profundis, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HUPFwrmgLvQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version is an poem written by J. R. R. Tolkien to the universe of The Lord of The Rings. It has 3 stanzas with 4 verses each and talks about Gil-Galad, an legendary king of the elves from a distant age.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&#x27;s take a look at the lyrics:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;1  Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
2  Of him the harpers sadly sing:
3  the last whose realm was fair and free
4  between the Mountains and the Sea.

5  His sword was long, his lance was keen,
6  his shining helm afar was seen;
7  the countless stars of heaven&#x27;s field
8  were mirrored in his silver shield.

9  But long ago he rode away,
10 and where he dwelleth none can say;
11 for into darkness fell his star
12 in Mordor where the shadows are.
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stanzas, we have the introduction of who was Gil-Galad, and becomes clear that he was loved by the people. Also in the third verse &amp;quot;the last whose realm was fair and free&amp;quot;, we can assume that the new kings don&#x27;t have a big appeal from the people, and can&#x27;t be compared with the greatness of Gil-Galad. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second one, we have an more detailed description of him: the fifth verse says how he was a great warrior; the sixth how he was an moralizing figure in the battlefield.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last one, we have turning point, now Gil-Galad is not more portrayed with glory, because now he&#x27;s dead.The first verse of this stanza tells us about this death, and the last three are very sad, because the hero is death like a indigent, with his body in the middle of the darkness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&#x27;s move to the musical version from Clamavi De Profundis.The first stanza is sung with a melancholy voice, giving us the sentiment that the elven king that is being introduced is really missed in the hearts of the people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second changes the voice a little bit, now it&#x27;s very excited remembering the glory of the past times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the poem, there&#x27;s a great change in the third stanza. It&#x27;s like the narrator falls deep in the sadness, when he says that Gil-Galad is death. The voice and music keep up with this, becoming sadder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
